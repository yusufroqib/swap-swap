# Zentra: DeFi Launchpad & Swap Platform

## Project Description

Zentra is an innovative DeFi ecosystem powering the future of token launches on the Pharos blockchain. Our comprehensive platform empowers projects with enterprise-grade tools for seamless token creation, fair launches, and efficient liquidity management. The ecosystem features two synergistic components:

1. **Zentra Launchpad**: An advanced token launching platform that enables projects to effortlessly create and deploy customizable tokens with robust features, transparent launch mechanisms, and enhanced security controls.

2. **Zentra Swap**: A high-performance decentralized exchange (DEX) optimized for the Pharos network, providing frictionless trading for all tokens launched through our platform with intuitive user experience.

### Core Value Proposition

As an early infrastructure provider for the promising Pharos ecosystem, Zentra delivers essential DeFi primitives that unlock the full potential of this innovative blockchain. Our platform offers:

- Sophisticated token creation with multiple customizable token types
- Transparent and equitable launch mechanisms for fair distribution
- Advanced liquidity provision and management solutions
- Seamless trading experience through an optimized interface

## Technical Foundation

Zentra Swap is built on the robust foundation of Uniswap Interface v4.266.2, the last version without added UI fees and that still allows users to do local routing. We've significantly improved the interface's censorship resistance and privacy while maintaining its core functionality.

### Key Technical Improvements

- Enhanced censorship resistance and privacy
- Removed centralized dependencies
- Optimized for Pharos blockchain
- Improved security and transparency
- Streamlined user experience

## Technical Architecture

Zentra's architecture consists of modular smart contracts that handle different aspects of the ecosystem:

- **Token System**: Handles token creation, management, and features
- **Launch System**: Manages fair token launches with security controls
- **Pool Factory**: Facilitates liquidity pool creation and management
- **Swap Router**: Enables token swapping with optimized routing

### Security Mechanisms

- Multiple contract types for different security levels
- Emergency pause functionality
- Admin controls
- Audit trails
- Transaction limits
- Fee management

## Features
