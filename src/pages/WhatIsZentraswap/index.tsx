						source={`## What is Zentraswap?

**Zentraswap** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the **Pharos network**, designed to enable secure, permissionless, and efficient trading of digital assets. As a hybrid fork of **Uniswap V2 and V3**, Zentraswap offers both classic liquidity pools and concentrated liquidity capabilities â€” empowering traders and liquidity providers with flexibility and capital efficiency.

Zentraswap is one of several products being developed under the same protocol, with each product designed to serve a specific function within the broader DeFi ecosystem on Pharos.

---

### âš¡ Built for Performance on Pharos

* **Low-Cost & High-Speed:** Leveraging Pharosâ€™s performance-focused architecture, Zentraswap delivers fast, low-fee transactions.
* **Smart Routing:** Zentraswap features a built-in **Smart Router** that dynamically finds the best trade path across available pools, ensuring users always get the most favorable price with minimal slippage.
* **Dual Liquidity Models:** LPs can choose between simple 50/50 V2 pools or advanced V3 pools with custom price ranges and multiple fee tiers.

---

### ðŸ”— Ecosystem-Aware, Interoperable by Design

Zentraswap is a standalone DEX â€” but it doesnâ€™t operate in isolation. It integrates seamlessly with other products in the same protocol, including our **Launchpad**, [Zentra](https://zentrafi.vercel.app/).

This allows tokens launched on the Launchpad to:

* Migrate liquidity to Zentraswap after hitting their launch targets
* Become instantly tradable on a decentralized exchange
* Leverage Zentraswapâ€™s deep liquidity and smart routing from day one

The two systems are distinct but interoperable, built to strengthen the Pharos DeFi ecosystem together.

---

### ðŸ’§ For Liquidity Providers

* **Earn trading fees** from every swap in your pool
* **Choose your strategy:** Passive LPing via V2 or precision control via V3
* **Select your fee tier:** Optimize for volatility and trading volume

---

### ðŸ”¥ Why Zentraswap?

* **Decentralized & Non-Custodial:** You stay in control of your assets at all times
* **Optimized Trades:** Smart Router delivers the best execution path
* **Pharos-native:** Runs on a high-performance chain built for scalable DeFi
* **Ecosystem-Friendly:** Built to plug into wallets, dApps, launchpads, and more
* **Open and Evolving:** Part of a protocol committed to expanding the decentralized future

---

### ðŸš€ Zentraswap Is For:

* Traders looking for fast, low-slippage swaps
* LPs seeking efficient, customizable yield strategies
* Projects needing reliable secondary liquidity
* Developers building on the Pharos chain
* Users participating in a larger decentralized protocol ecosystem

---

Zentraswap is more than just a swap â€” it's the core trading layer of a broader vision for decentralized finance on Pharos.
